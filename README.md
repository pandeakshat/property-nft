<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The project is to develop a decentralised application, which would allow landlords to easily pull equity from their properties by selling a percentage of their property using NFTs; therefore, it aims to resolve the limitations identified within the alternative possible solutions. Furthermore, investors would have numerous properties available to them and can control how much is invested in different properties. In addition, by removing intermediary organisations through a decentralised application, we can decrease the cost of connecting property share investors to equity-seeking landlords.
